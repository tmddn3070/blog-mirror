## Set the cover image using the `image` attribute

Select an Image: Before you start, make sure you have an image you want to use as a cover. Let's assume its filename is my-cover-image.jpg and it's located in an images directory at the root of your site.

Edit your article: At the top of your Markdown file, include the frontmatter section. Set the `image` attribute to the path of your image file.
